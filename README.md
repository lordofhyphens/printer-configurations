# printer-configurations
Git repo of my personal slic3r settings for my printers.


They're intended for my own printers and may not work for you.

## WARNING
Be *VERY* cautious about any of the Printer profiles, most of them contain Gcode meant for the specific printers I have and may cause your printer to try to break itself if you use them as-is without reading and customizing for your printer.
